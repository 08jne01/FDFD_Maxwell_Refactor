# FDFD Maxwell-Equation-Solver

This is a Finite Difference Frequency Domain sovler for maxwells equations in an optical fiber/waveguide implemented in C++. This is an implementation of the paper: https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.10.000853.

Some example modes in different fibers https://imgur.com/a/CVyIGNq

**Results are not confirmed to be accurate yet, this is a WIP project!!**

Dependancies:
- SFML for rendering
- Eigen3 for sparse and dense matrices
- Spectra for sparse eigen solving

**Install (windows)**

To install just extract binary zip into a folder, be sure to keep the folders with the executable.

**Usage**
